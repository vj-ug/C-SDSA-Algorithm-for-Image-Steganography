# C# program for Image-Steganography using SDSA Algorithm

Steganography  is the art of concealing an image, message and file within another image,message or file.
I developed C# program for a very recent algorithm published in IEEE in 2014  for image steganography.

The SDSA algorithm is based on the concept of the short distance of the consecutive points and the small angle between the consecutive vectors formed by three adjacent points.  But in May 2014, according to [1] a modification was presented of the newly developed SDSA algorithm (MSDS). The MSDS algorithm is suitable for almost all test data sets for point symmetry based K-means (PSK) algorithm and SDSA algorithm
